## Introduction

Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (And believe there is a rainbow of them). The projects in this repository range from beginner-friendly to more advanced topics (Find the chart of difficulty levels in the levels.md), providing opportunities for learning and exploration at various skill levels.

## Projects

### 1. CO2 and Temperature Monitoring System

- **Description**: A web-based monitoring system for CO2 levels and temperature, utilizing a Raspberry Pi, an MH-Z19 CO2 sensor, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
- **Features**:
  - Web-based interface for monitoring CO2 levels and temperature.
  - Simple authentication mechanism for accessing the monitoring interface.
  - Automatic updating of sensor data in the background.
  - Visual representation of sensor data using charts.
  - Doesn't yet have a database fetching mechanism, I don't know if I will implement one cause of how many errors I get each time
- **Repository Path**: [CO2 and Temperature Monitoring System](https://github.com/AnonymousApexio/co2-temperature-monitoring)
